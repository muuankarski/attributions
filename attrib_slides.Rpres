Purpose of the study
========================================================

## 1. Cross-national differences

*To what extent there are cross-national differences in attributions for poverty in post-socialist countries?*

## 2. Determinants

*Can perceptions be attributed to certain contextual and individual level factors?*

1. Individual level: specific risks related to household financial circumstances
2. Contextual level: goodness of the government, human development and changes in national economy


Welfare attitudes vs. welfare state policies
======================================================

Causation between attitutes and policies is believed to exist in both directions:

1. Welfare attitudes constrain the decision making and institutional change by limiting the range of programs perceived acceptable
2. Type of welfare policy affects the welfare attitudes
    - in countries with more marginal and less generous welfare programmes, explanations of poverty are more often based on **individual morality**
    - in the Continental and Nordic welfare states **external and structural** explanations prevail

 
Different types of explanations

Assumptions
========================================================

## Cross-national differences
- Difference between post-socialist and West of Europe
- Large variation within post-socialist regime

## Individual level determinants:
- Self-interest approach: *to what extent risk factors related to financial hardship are associated with perceptions of the causes of poverty*

## Contextual level determinants:
-  Differencies in socio-economic conditions and in governance
    1. economic performance during the period of global financial crises
    2. human development
    3. goodness of government

Data
========================================================
## Life in Transition Survey - 2nd round (LiTS2)
- collected in late 2010 in 34 countries and 39000 households
- assess public attitudes, well-being and the impacts of economic and political change at the household level
- special emphasis on how lives have been affected by the global economic crisis and its aftermath
- ...with contextual level data from World Bank (derived from Quality of Government -data)

21 Post-Socialist and 5 Western European countries
===================================

Novelty of the study
=======================================================
- in depth study of "post-socialist welfare regime"
- wider variety of political and economical regimes
    - dynamics of welfare attitudes, welfare state and democracy in authoritarian regimes
- assessing the impact of past, present and future expectations
- comparing countries that have suffered from financial crisis and countries that have not

<h1>Dependent variable</h1>


Dependent variable
========================================================
*In your opinion, what is the main reason why there are some people in need in our country today?* (Variable `q309` in LiTS-data)
- Because they have been unlucky
- Because of laziness and lack of willpower
- Because of injustice in our society
- It is an inevitable part of modern life
- Don't know
- Not stated


<!-- ---| notes begin |--------------------------------
So, here is the question in regard to our dependent variable. This is a standard force-choice question which has been used also in other international surveys (e.g. Wold Values Study, Eurobarometer). Force-choice means that respondent has to pick one of the four explanations.
In regard to van Oorschot and Halman's typology of explanations, they equates "Unlucky" as individual fate, "laziness" as individual blame, "injustice" as social blame and "modern life" as social fate.

Regression modelling
========================================================

Constraints
---------------------------------------------------

- DV is categorical/factor with values: A,B,C,D
- Major differences in IV's by country 
    - clustered data (individual within countries)
    - multilevel/mixed effects model setting
    
Current solution
----------------------------------------------------

- As we are interested in two blame type of explanation
- Our current solution to recode variable into two binary variables
    - 1. A/not-A
    - 1. B/not-B and 
- model the data using logistic binary multilevel models for A/not-A, B/not-B and A/B

- between-country variance .29 vs. .12, after individual predictors .23, .10, after gdp change .13 vs .05

individual level predictors
-------------------------------------------

- social blame
    - of sign. Perceived low income level, Expected change in income over the next four years, suffered the financial crisis
    - of non-sign. Low education, worsened household income level
- individual blame
    - of sign. all predictors, suffered the financial crisis

contextual level predictors

<h1>Questions & comments</h1>



<!-- ---| notes begin |--------------------------------
Between-country variances meaning the variance independent variable that is explained by country differences. Variance in empty models is.29 in social blame and .12 in individual blame indicating that there 
1. are differences betweencountries, and that 
2. differences are greater in respect to support for social blame type of explanation. 

Looking at the deviance for the empty models both in tables 4 and 5, we can see that thereis ‚Äùless‚Äù to be explained for in the model for individual blame than for social blame. 
When adding the individual level predictors to the models, the deviance decreases by 8512 forsocial blame and 6636 for individual blame. In both model sb1 and ib1 we have four sta-tistically significant predictors. Low education and worsened household income level donot contribute in explaining neither of the outcomes. Perceived low income level has thehighest coefficient of our binary individual level predictors for explaining social blame typeof explanation. Coefficient of .368 can be translated so that if respondent perceives be-longing to low income group he or she is 9.2% more likely to blame society for povertythan a non-low income individual. Expected worsening in household income and financialcrises experince predict social blame almost in similar manner. All our individual level pre-dictors but low education predict lower probability for supporting individual blame (modelib1). Being greatly affected by financial crisis makes one 11% less likely to support forindividual blame type of explanation.

whereas gini coefficient has a weak connection to individual blame type of explana-tion, so that individual blame is supported more in more unequal countries, as we assumedbased on studies about the association between generalised trust and equality (Uslander2002). 

Inclusion of change in national GDP between 2007 - 2010 substracts the devianceby 14 for social blame and 9 for individual blame model. Change in GDP becomes the mostsignificant predictor of our country level variables for both type of explanation. 

The betterthe national economy has performed during the financial crises, the more probably is thesupport for individual blame type of explanation. Outcome is very much align with the find-ings of Gallie and Paugam (2002) and Kallio and Niemel Ãàa (2010). Our fourth contextualvariable, democracy index, is significant in explaining the individual blame in a way thathigher level of democracy implies lower support for individual blame type of explanation.Coefficient plots from both full models summarizes the estimates for logistic regressioncoefficients at 50% and 90% intervals in figure 7.

As for explaining the between-country variation the inclusion of country grouping adds avery little. Gini coefficient reduces variation from .24 to .19 for social blame, but it isthe inclusion of GDP change that has the greatest effect. Between-country variation to.12 for social blame and .04 for individual blame. In the final models the inclusion ofdemocracy index results country-level variances at .09 and .02 for social and individualtype of explanation, respectively. In other words, only 9% and 2% of the variation in thefinal models are due to country differences at final stage.
