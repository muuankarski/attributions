Dreher KOF Index of Globalization
==============================

http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ (2013-03-07) (Dreher 2006; Dreher et al 2008)

All indexes below range between 0 and 100, where higher values indicate a higher degree of
globalization.

Social Globalization

Social globalization is measured by three categories of indicators. The first is personal contacts, such
as telephone traffic and tourism. The second is information flows, e.g. number of Internet users. The
third is cultural proximity, e.g. trade in books and number of Ikea warehouses per capita.

Political Constraints Index III

This index measures the feasibility of policy change, i.e. the extent to which a change in the preferences of any one political actor may lead to a change in government policy. The index is composed from the following information: the number of independent branches of government with veto power over policy change, counting the executive and the presence of an effective lower and upper house in the legislature (more branches leading to more constraint); the extent of party alignment across branches of government, measured as the extent to which the same party or coalition of parties control each branch (decreasing the level of constraint); and the extent of preference heterogeneity within each legislative branch, measured as legislative fractionalization in the relevant house (increasing constraint for aligned executives, decreasing it for opposed executives). The index scores are derived from a simple spatial model and theoretically ranges from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating more political constraint and thus less feasibility of policy change. Note that the coding reflects information as of January 1 in any given year. Henisz (2002) uses this index to demonstrate that political environments that limit the feasibility of policy change are an important determinant of investment in infrastructure.

Human Development Index

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index that measures the average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, as measured by life expectancy at birth; knowledge, as measured by the adult literacy rate and the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary schools; and a decent standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) US dollars.


Vanhanen - Index of Democratization
===================================

http://www.fsd.uta.fi/en/data/catalogue/FSD1289/index.html (Vanhanen 2011) (2013-01-30)

Three different variables, created by Tatu Vanhanen in his long-term research, for each year from 1946 to 2010. The variables in question are political competition, political participation and the index of
democratization.

Note: The original source provide values from 1810.

Index of Democratization

This index combines two basic dimensions of democracy – competition and participation – measured as the percentage of votes not cast for the largest party (Competition) times the percentage of the population who actually voted in the election (Participation). This product is di-vided by 100 to form an index that in principle could vary from 0 (no democracy) to 100 (full democracy). (Empirically, however, the largest value is 49).

Cingranelli & Richards - Human Rights Dataset
=========================================

http://www.humanrightsdata.org/ (2013-01-22) (Cingranelli & Richards 2010)

The Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Dataset contains standards-based quantitative
information on government respect for 15 internationally recognized human rights for 195 countries,
annually from 1981-2010. It is designed for use by scholars and students who seek to test theories
about the causes and consequences of human rights violations, as well as policy makers and analysts
who seek to estimate the human rights effects of a wide variety of institutional changes and public
policies including democratization, economic aid, military aid, structural adjustment, and humanitarian
intervention.

Empowerment Rights Index (new)

This is an additive index constructed from the Foreign Movement, Domestic Movement, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Assembly & Association, Workers’ Rights, Electoral Self-Determination, and Freedom of Religion indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government respect for these seven rights) to 14 (full government respect for these seven rights).


ciri_assn 
------------------------------
.22/-.30

It is an internationally recognized right of citizens to assemble freely and to associate with other persons in political parties, trade unions, cultural organizations, or other special-interest groups. This
variable indicates the extent to which the freedoms of assembly and association are subject to actual governmental limitations or restrictions (as opposed to strictly legal protections).

(0) Citizens’ rights to freedom of assembly or association were severely restricted or denied completely to all citizens.
(1) These rights were limited for all citizens or severely restricted or denied for select groups.
(2) These rights were virtually unrestricted and freely enjoyed by practically all citizens.

Countries are graded between 0 (worst) and 12 (best).



Polity IV Polity IV Project Data Set
==========================
http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm (Marshall & Jaggers 2011) (2013-02-29)

The Polity project is one of the most widely used data resource for studying regime change and the
effects of regime authority.


p_polity2
------------------------
.51/-.51

Revised Combined Polity Score

The polity score is computed by subtracting the p_autoc score from the p_democ score; the resulting unified polity scale ranges from +10 (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic). The revised version of the polity variable is designed to facilitate the use of the polity regime measure in time-series analyses. It modifies the combined annual polity score by applying a simple treatment, or ““fix,” to convert instances of “standardized authority scores” (i.e. -66, -77, and -88) to conventional polity scores (i.e. within the range, -10 to +10). The values have been converted according to the following rule set:

| code  | desc |
| ----- | --------| 
| (-66) | Cases of foreign “interruption” are treated as “system missing”. |
| (-77) | Cases of “interregnum,” or anarchy, are converted to a “neutral” Polity score of “0”. |
| (-88) | Cases of “transition” are prorated across the span of the transition. |


For example, country X has a p_polity score of -7 in 1957, followed by three years of -88 and, finally, a score of +5 in 1961. The change (+12) would be prorated over the intervening three years at a rate of per year, so that the converted scores would be as follow: 1957 -7; 1958 -4; 1959 -1; 1960 +2; and
1961 +5.

Note: Ongoing (-88) transitions in the most recent year are converted to “system missing” values. Transitions (-88) following a year of independence, interruption (-66), or interregnum (-77) are prorated from the value “0”.

Corruption Perceptions Index – Standard Deviation

This is the standard deviation in the values of the sources underlying the CPI: the greater the standard deviation, the greater the differences of perceptions of a country among the sources.


ti_cpi
------------------
.24/-.41

Corruption Perceptions Index

The CPI focuses on corruption in the public sector and defines corruption as the abuse of public office for private gain. The surveys used in compiling the CPI tend to ask questions in line with the misuse of public power for private benefit, with a focus, for example, on bribe-taking by public officials in public procurement. The sources do not distinguish between administrative and political corruption. The CPI Score relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people, risk analysts and the general public and ranges between 10 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt).

Note: The time-series information in the CPI scores can only be used if interpreted with caution. Year-to-year shifts in a country’s score can result not only from a changing perception of a country's performance but also from a changing sample and methodology. That is, with differing respondents and slightly differing methodologies, a change in a country's score may also relate to the fact that different viewpoints have been collected and different questions have been asked. Moreover, each country’s CPI score is composed as a 3-year moving average, implying that if changes occur they only gradually affect a country’s score. For a more detailed discussion of comparability over time in the CPI, see Lambsdorff 2005.

Note: In 2012 TI changed to a scale ranging from 0-100 only assigning whole numbers. We have decided to divide the values for 2

GDP Growth (%)

Annual percentage growth rate of GDP at market prices based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2000 U.S. dollars. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

GNI per Capita, Atlas method (current US$)

GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad. GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000, the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States). From 2001, these countries include the Euro area, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

GDP per capita, PPP (constant international $)

GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using  purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2005 international dollars.
